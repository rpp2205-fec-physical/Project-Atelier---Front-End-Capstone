# Project Atelier - Front End Capstone

Front End Capstone project for Hack Reactor

Our team of 2 built out the entire codebase from the ground up, from the Node/ Express server to the React front-end. A virtual storefront with featured product overview, related products, and shopping cart all served up from the API. A deep dive into code modularity and real-world app development.
